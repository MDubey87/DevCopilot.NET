Coding Standards - Engineering Team

1. All async methods must use the "Async" suffix.
2. File names should match class names exactly.
3. Use dependency injection instead of static service access.
4. Avoid business logic inside controllers or endpoints; use the application layer.
5. Always include XML documentation on public methods for shared libraries.
6. Use "var" only when the type is obvious.
7. Use meaningful, descriptive names for variables and methods.
